#1 LEARN STRING MANIPULATION BY BUILDING A CYPHER:
Python is a powerful and popular programming language widely used for data science, data visualization, web development, game development, machine learning and more.
In this project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. You'll use these to code your first programs.
#2 LEARN HOW TO WORK WITH NUMBERS, AND STRINGS BY IMPLEMENTING THE LUHN ALGORITHM:
The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers.

By building this project, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.
