# 1-LEARN STRING MANIPULATION BY BUILDING A CYPHER
Python is a powerful and popular programming language widely used for data science, data visualization, web development, game development, machine learning and more.
In this project, you'll learn fundamental programming concepts in Python, such as variables, functions, loops, and conditional statements. You'll use these to code your first programs.

# 2-LEARN HOW TO WORK WITH NUMBERS, AND STRINGS BY IMPLEMENTING THE LUHN ALGORITHM:
The Luhn Algorithm is widely used for error-checking in various applications, such as verifying credit card numbers.
By building this project, you'll gain experience working with numerical computations and string manipulation.

# 3-Learn Lambda Functions by Building an Expense Tracker:
Lambda functions give you a concise way to write small, throwaway functions in your code.
In this project, you'll explore the power of Lambda Functions by creating an expense tracker. Your resulting app will demonstrate how you can use Lambda Functions for efficient, streamlined operations.

# 4-Learn Python List Comprehension By Building a Case Converter Program
List Comprehension is a way to construct a new Python list from an iterable types: lists, tuples, and strings. All without using a for loop or the `.append()` list method.
In this project, you'll write a program that takes a string formatted in Camel Case or Pascal Case, then converts it into Snake Case.

# 5-Learn Algorithm Design by Building a Shortest Path Algorithm
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures that developers use to perform calculations and solve computational problems.
In this project, you'll learn how to use functions, loops, conditional statements, and dictionary comprehensions to implement a Shortest Path algorithm.
The project has two phases: first you'll use a for loop to implement the program. Then you'll learn how to use List Comprehension instead of a loop to achieve the same results.

# 6-Learn Regular Expressions by Building a Password Generator
A Python module is a file that contains a set of statements and definitions that you can use in your code.
In this project, you'll learn how to import modules from the Python standard library. You'll also learn how to use Regular Expressions by building your own password generator program.

# 7-Learn Recursion by Solving the Tower of Hanoi Puzzle
Recursion is a programming approach that allows you to solve complicated computational problems with just a little code.
In this project, you'll start with a loop-based approach to solving the tower of Hanoi mathematical puzzle. Then you'll learn how to implement a recursive solution.
